This repository containes solutions of [problems](https://starttechacademy.com/courses/step-i-ml/lessons/task-2/) given in machine learning track on StartTech step-i progrem.

### Problem 1
We have to create a linear regression model in Python or R to predict the CTC/Salary of new hires from the data provided. Dataset for this problem can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bcOXd9dFhgxsmonqC0TtFLQrAKfzxQNL/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106115340208586563833&rtpof=true&sd=true)
.

`Problem 1 Predict_CTC.ipynb` file containes solution for this problem.

### Problem 2
We have to create a deep learning model that can detect if osteoarthritis is present or not in a given knee X-ray image. Dataset for this problem can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y7AO4RHDLYYvjGMlZX2NBTpSFWho1Jyg?usp=sharing)
